        <h2>How can teachers and administrators access attendance reports?</h2>
        <p>Teachers and administrators can access attendance reports through the reports pages. The reports provide detailed information about attendance statistics.</p>

        <h2>What if there is a technical issue with the facial recognition system?</h2>
        <p>In case of any technical issues, students and teachers can contact technical support through the help and support page. The technical support team will work to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.</p>

        <h2>Is the facial recognition system compliant with privacy laws?</h2>
